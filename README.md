# Data Analysis Project

This project was developed for the Data Analysis exam at the University of Pisa, aiming to analyze and classify medical data across two distinct domains: cirrhosis stage prediction and diagnostic imaging for Covid-19.

To achieve these goals, various machine learning techniques were applied, including **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Neural Networks** (including Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition).

The analysis includes:
1. **Cirrhosis Prediction**: Applying classification techniques to determine the disease stage of patients using the Cirrhosis Prediction Dataset.
2. **Covid-19 Image Classification**: Developing an image recognition model to distinguish between healthy individuals, those with viral pneumonia, and those with Covid-19, using the Covid-19 Image Dataset.
